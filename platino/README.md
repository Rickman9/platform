### Lanica Platino Engine™
![image](http://lanica.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/smallPlatinoEngine.png)

An optimized, native-built, cross-platform game engine for JavaScript developers, with a rich API set to support iOS and Android mobile games! The Lanica Platino Engine leverages the Appcelerator Titanium SDK, which has over 5,000 device and mobile operating system APIs. Additionally, you can use the many modules created by the Titanium community of over a half-million developers, ISVs, and partners who have extended the SDK with user interface controls, access to 3rd party services, and hundreds of native platform APIs.

**OpenGL**:  We’re bringing you the industry standard in hardware-accelerated, cross-platform API for 2D and 3D graphics.  The OpenGL engine is a flexible and powerful low-level interface between software and graphics acceleration, so you get the best performance with the most efficient (i.e. lowest possible) use of resources.

**Isometric Tile Engine**:  Our native isometric engine is written entirely in C++.  The best part? It features direct hardware rendering and occlusion detection for your maps to be rendered at full hardware speed, giving them near real-time interactivity.

**Sprite Sheets**: Our internal sprite sheet engine is optimized for performance and rendering.

**Box2D**: The same physics engine that drives Angry Birds and some of the most popular mobile games on the market is embedded in the Platino game engine.

**Particles**: We know you’re too creative for a “one size fits all” approach. You can now create stunning visual effects at hardware speeds by customizing every aspect of your particle emitters.

**2.5D Support**: Built natively (yet again!) to give your game that extra “depth” needed to create pseudo-3D effects.

**Native Interface Access**: Full access to your creations, so you can tinker with the native UI, mouse events, accelerometer, and more through Titanium’s powerful JavaScript methods and classes.

**JavaScript**: Leveraging the most popular language and its ecosystem, including hundreds of client-side Appcelerator Marketplace Modules and cloud-based services for extended capabilities.
